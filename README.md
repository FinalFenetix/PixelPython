# **PyTerminal Game Engine**

**PyTerminal is a 'Game Engine', if you can even call it that**. It runs in the terminal, its a top-down 2D game engine sorta and has collision physics and movement.

**Here's what I plan on adding:**

Entity Creator class to help make new objects and characters easy
Built-in dialogue system (if you want to have NPCs)
Gravity physics!!!!
A wider variety of emojis to use for the terminal
I'm going to add to this list the more ideas I get!
