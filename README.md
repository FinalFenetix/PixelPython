# **PyxelTerm Game Engine**

**PyxelTerm is a 'Game Engine', if you can even call it that**. It runs in the terminal, its a 2D game engine sorta and has collision physics and movement.

**Here's what I plan on adding:**

- Built-in dialogue system (if you want to have NPCs)
- Gravity physics!!!!
I'm going to add to this list the more ideas I get!
